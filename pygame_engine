Engine names: 
	Flux Engine

approuch:
	Engine development environment (entire implementation of engine which uses pygame in the background)
		engine imports pygame
	Sandbox development environment (sandbox to use engine in order to test and play with its components)
		sandbox imports engine, which imports pygame (so anything thats not improved/implemented can just use pygame directry)

GUI:
	console(allows you to look at values and variables, load levels and worlds, debug and so on so forth)
		big console, small console, both toggle
	prefabs(drag and drop prefabs into the game)
	folder/file manager(create sub directories and manage your game files and assets)
	pause, frame by frame stepping feature, (maybe rewind)(pause button, left right arrows, play button)(play x speed 0.1-1-5)
	recording feature(to play back segments of gameplay and look at values and variables as they change)
	drag drop tiles (mouse)
	resizable tiles (mouse)
	resizable coliders (mouse)
	changable variables(xyz, size, ext)

OTHER:
	parent child relationships
	optional? ecs (have the work flow complete so that user can just create entities, give them components,
		and have systems interact with those components if they exist in the world)

	layers, layer indicators to show only things on certain layers or toggle on off
		small numbers indicating what layer each sprite/image is on


	mouse wheel zoom in/out (maybe)
	left mouse hold drag left right up down (camera)

	debug release modes. Have debug elements not present when you release
		create a way to release an installer/exe
	hotloading
	logging
	asserts
	screenshots

Quality of life:


Engine:
	make entry point
	key codes
	renderer
	window
	events: there are built in events, but want to look into writing my own. Should have an event buffer with an event bus
		and process them during the "event" part of the update stage
	loading images/sprites/ects

IMPROVEMENTS:
	make sprite sheets easier
	make standard pygame stuff easier (drawing, etc)
	make font/text better
	make a renderer
	make calls through engine not graphics library, (every call should be an engine call at some point.
		pygame calls should be happening in the background)
	...


---TODO---

universal draw:
    please do this asap omfg

sprite layers:
    need to have layers for sprite to determine draw order and have it easily modifiable

bugs:
    also looks like there is a text_input and repeat functionality built in... pygame.key.___
    special symbols on key up arnt registering cause they are mod=1
    if ` or ~ it auto registers are text input, so need to accept on next key down

object selection:
    create layers for polygons - to improve selection process, to improve draw order,
        more console commands
    adding console commands for selected object - showing data, deleting, maybe creating

text input:
    improvements:
        tab completes should turn into a second layer that shows a list of all
        the available commands
    important:
        copy paste to clipboard
    not important:
        wrapping lines
done:
    tab complete from commands - second tab gets next item in list
    ctrl r for history
    print() to my console
	hold repeat on text input and backspace - needs to be handled in events as part of key_pressed bool True or another type of key pressed
	mouse scrollwheel for output
	pressing down to 0 index doesnt bring back textbox text, needs to come back
	movable curosor with arrows
	edite at cursor position
	up down arrow to go to history
	process input as commands, maybe dont add to history anymore and instead output recognized command success "success command - %s" and unrecognized command fail "unrecognized command - %s"
    saving/loading maps
